# Vexillum
This c library takes the arguments which the program received and parses them into an nicely accessible form.

## Name
If you are wondering where I got the name from. I remembered that the study of flags is called Vexillology. That name comes from the latin word for flag which is vexillum.

## Form
The form with which the arguments will get converted is based on how shell scripts handle flags.

## Usage
